# Cookie Policy

## Introduction

This Cookie Policy explains how CentriaCyber uses cookies and similar technologies to provide, personalize, and improve your experience on our Booking System web application ("the Service"). By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies in accordance with this policy.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that a website stores on your device (smartphones, computers, etc.) when you browse the internet. They are created when your browser loads a particular website, and the site sends information to your browser, which then creates a text file. Cookies can store a range of information, including personal data (such as name, home address, email address) and information about your preferred language or location, allowing the site to present you with information customized to fit your needs.

### Session Cookies

Session cookies are cookies that last only for the duration of your session. A session starts when you launch a website or web app and ends when you leave the website or close your browser window. Session cookies store information temporarily in a memory location, which is deleted after the session ends. They are not stored on your device, and therefore, they are also called transient cookies, non-persistent cookies, or temporary cookies.

#### How Do Session Cookies Work?

Session cookies are essential for websites to function properly. They allow the website to remember your actions and preferences as you navigate between pages. For example, they may store your shopping cart items during a session. Without session cookies, websites would treat each page load as a new, separate session.

#### Are Session Cookies GDPR Compliant?

Yes, session cookies are exempt from consent requirements under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). They are considered **strictly necessary cookies** because they are essential for the basic operation of the website, such as enabling you to navigate the site or complete a booking. These cookies do not collect personal information and are necessary for the service's functionality.

### Types of Cookies We Use
